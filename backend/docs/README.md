# Backend Docs

This directory contains auto-generated OpenAPI and Swagger documentation files for the backend API.

- `swagger.json`: Swagger 2.0 spec generated by swag CLI
- `openapi.json`: Copy of swagger.json for compatibility
- `docs.go`: Go source file for Swagger UI integration
- `swagger.yaml`: YAML version of the spec

> Do not edit these files manually. Regenerate using `go generate ./...` in the backend directory.

## Why is this directory present?
- Required for OpenAPI parity check in CI
- Excluded from backend test coverage and test runs
